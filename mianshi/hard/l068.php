/**
 *Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters 最多有K个不同字符的最长子串


Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, Given s = “eceba” and k = 2,

T is "ece" which its length is 3.



这道题是之前那道Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters的拓展，而且那道题中的解法一和解法二直接将2换成k就行了
