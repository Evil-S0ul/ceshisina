| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |

这道题是之前那道Department Highest Salary的拓展，难度标记为Hard，还是蛮有难度的一道题，综合了前面很多题的知识点，首先看使用Select Count(Distinct)的方法，我们内交Employee和Department两张表，然后我们找出比当前薪水高的最多只能有两个，那么前三高的都能被取出来了，
